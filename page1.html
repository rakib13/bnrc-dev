        <h1>Chinese Ambassador Wen meets Khaleda Zia</h1>
        <img src="images/khaledazia.jpeg">
        <p>
            China's Ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen has met BNP Chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia at her
            residence Feroza in Gulshan.

            The envoy’s flag-bearing car entered the residence at 8:30pm on Wednesday. BNP Standing
            Committee member AZM Zahid Hossain and Vice-Chairman Altaf Hossain Chowdhury were present during
            the meeting.

            After the meeting, Altaf said: “The Chinese ambassador, along with the deputy chief of mission,
            political attaché, and another embassy official, paid a courtesy visit to Khaleda Zia.”

            He added, “They stayed for quite a while and discussed the longstanding friendship between the
            BNP and the Communist Party of China. They also shared their vision for strengthening future
            relations."

            The BNP leader continued, “The ambassador fondly recalled late president Ziaur Rahman as the
            pioneer of Bangladesh-China diplomatic relations. They also spoke about the ‘Look East Policy’
            during Begum Khaleda Zia’s time in office.”

            The Chinese envoy also extended an invitation for the BNP chief to visit China and offered
            assistance for medical treatment if needed.

            Zahid said the ambassador recalled the 2016 meeting between the former minister and Chinese
            President Xi Jinping and conveyed the Communist Party's regards to her.

            Following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina regime on Aug 5, Khaleda was released under an executive
            order.



            Since then, several foreign diplomats have visited her at her residence. On Sept 5, British High
            Commissioner Sarah Cooke called on the BNP chairperson, followed by Saudi Ambassador Issa bin
            Youssef Al-Duhailan on Nov 25, and Pakistani High Commissioner Syed Ahmed Maroof on Dec 4.
